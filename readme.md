## How To Use Emojis
> + For default emojis, you can just use :emojiname: e.g `:white_check_mark:`
> + For custom emojis, write `\:emojiname:` into a channel. Discord will then automatically convert it into what is required and you can then just paste that into the message in the config.

> + In the message, replace each new line with `\n`
> + As an example, `"**Check out this site**\n*It Is Very Cool*\n\nhttp://bigrat.monster"`
